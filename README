This software utility is 'search.py', a python script for searching
files and directories, sort of a grep on steroids, though containing
aspects of find, tar, gzip, etc.  It takes multiple strings for
searching, can descend into directories, tar and zip files,
compressed files, etc, along with searching for blocks of lines
within files that contain the specified patterns, which can be
useful for searching things like XML files and mail files.
